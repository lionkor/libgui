# libgui

(heavy WIP)

A fast and simple C++ GUI library for X11. 
Support for other environments and OS's is on the roadmap.

## Philosophy

Systems back in the day used to be really fast in comparison to today. 
This is partially because of the many layers of abstractions that often
lie between the programmer and the hardware, which is a pretty new phenomenon. Instead of writing GUI apps using electron, I want to go back to the roots and design a GUI library for Desktop PCs that is fast and easy to use.
